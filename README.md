# Translations

These are the translation files for the Q1 2021 Xamarin survey. Are you ready and willing to help out? 

1. Grab https://poedit.net/ or your favorite editor.
2. Clone the repo and locate your language file.
3. Claim it by opening an issue so we don't duplicate work.
4. Translate! Some phrases are already translated. POEDIT also will suggest translations in the sidebar to help speed things along.
5. Save and PR the completed files here.

## Due Date?

I would like to start sending this out the week of March 15th.

Any questions, you can ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidortinau) or via [email](mailto:david.ortinau@microsoft.com).
